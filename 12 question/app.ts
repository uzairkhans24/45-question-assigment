// question 12 ====>Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
// print a message to them.
//  The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.



let Names:string[] = ["Maryam", "Ali", "Fahad", "Fizan", "Khakid" ];

console.log(`Hello ${Names[0]}, would you like to learn some typescript today? `);
console.log(`Hello ${Names[1]}, would you like to learn some typescript today? `);
console.log(`Hello ${Names[2]}, would you like to learn some typescript today? `);
console.log(`Hello ${Names[3]}, would you like to learn some typescript today? `);
console.log(`Hello ${Names[4]}, would you like to learn some typescript today? `);
