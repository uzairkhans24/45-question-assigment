//question  20 ---->Think of something you could store in a array. 
// For example, you could make a list of 
// mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything 
// else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.


const Locations: string[] = [
  "mount everest",
  "K2",
  "Dubai",
  "Sudia",
  "Chnanab",

console.log("\nList of Location");

for (let i = 0; i < Locations.length; i++) {
