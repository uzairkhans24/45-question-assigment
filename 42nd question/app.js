// question 42====>Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
//  Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians 
//  by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name.
//  Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magicians = ["Fahad", "Bilal", "Asif", "Hamza"];
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = magicians[i] + " the Great";
    }
}
make_great(magicians); // Modifies the original array
show_magicians(magicians); // Shows modified names
