// question 29 ======>Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit
// is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
var favorite_fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "mango", "orange"];
if (favorite_fruits.includes("bananas")) {
    console.log("You really like bananas!");
}
if (favorite_fruits.includes("orange")) {
    console.log("You really like orange!");
}
// Continue with more fruits
